# Portfolio-Website
I am in the process of making this website so that I have a place to showcase my portfolio. With this project, I have the opportunity to sharpen up my front-end skills and begin to learn some back-end development. I will be using video tutorials and language documentation.

### Motivation
I always had an interest in graphic design, and have numerous years of experience in Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. With this project, I have started to use Adobe XD, a vector-based design tool for web-apps. I use XD to create mock-ups which I then try to replicate through CSS code. Because of my experience with other Adobe programs, working with the XD interface was easy to adapt to.  
  
Currently, I use a google drive folder to showcase a large portion of my portfolio and I would rather showcase it through a thought-out eye-catching website.

## Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Angular (soon)

## Goals
From the start of this project, I have minimal experience in HTML and CSS. What I hope to achieve is proficient comprehension in HTML and CSS code. I also hope to transfer over to
Sass, which is a modern CSS extension language.  
  
For back-end, I hope to be able to learn enough to adequately publish a functional and professional website.  
  
As of the end of May, I have found an interest in React and Angular. I am still deciding on which framework to use (leaning towards Angular).

## Other notes
In the process, I have learned the Ruby language. I was also introduced to using the Cloud9 IDE on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
